Sublime Spam by Berthur/Jon G.

Welcome to Sublime Spam.

To play the game (after having extracted the zip file): open Run.jar with a current version of Java. *THIS MAY HAVE TO BE DONE THROUGH THE TERMINAL in order to work as intended.* This can be done using the following command:
java -jar Run.jar
from within the SublimeSpam directory.

On tracks with three rails, use G, H and J to hit the rails.
In the game, press Space to start and pause, and Esc to exit the song.

In order to record a song of your own, you need to have entered a valid username to the game (can be viewed and changed in the config file) and you need to create a folder with your exact username inside the 'tracks' directory. Additionally, you need to move any mp3 file you wish to play into this new directory and name it: 'trackname;artist.mp3'. After this, the mp3 file should appear as an option when choosing 'Record' in-game.

When choosing a track to record, a light grey window will appear. After pressing space once, the song will begin to play, and the recorder will record your presses on G, H and J. When you are done, press space again and the track will end there and be saved in your personal tracks folder (it can be altered manually), after you have chosen its difficulty. Keep in mind that there is no pausing in the recorder yet!


Happy playing.
