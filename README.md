# SublimeSpam
by Berthur / Jon G.
An old project of mine: A fun little music game.

This game was highly inspired on an old favourite game of mine: Tap Tap Revenge 3. Since it is a music game, musical tracks are required to play it. These tracks can be added and recorded by the player, or the player can import existing tracks from elsewhere. It is possible that existing tracks will be found in this repository as well, but in that case, they are only for test purposes and their respective creators only take credit for the SublimeSpam track files - not the mp3 files.

> NB! Some files, in particular any sound files that may be included in the 'tracks' directory may have been distributed along with the project, but these ARE NOT considered part of this project. For more information, visit the README inside this directory.


Please read Instr.txt file for instructions on how to play.
## QUICK INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO DOWNLOAD AND RUN:
1. When in the 'code' tab of this GitHub repository, select 'Clone or download' (on the right hand side) and then 'Download ZIP'.
2. Download and extract the ZIP file to your desired location.
3. Make sure you have a up-to-date version of Java installed on your computer.
4. Open the `Run.jar` file with Java. If this fails, you may have to do it through your command prompt (`java -jar Run.jar`, after having navigated into the game directory (e.g. `cd Desktop/SublimeSpamFolderName` if it is located on your Desktop))
